    <p>At Pleased by Paws, we go above and beyond generic group classes to provide a unique training experience tailored to your needs. Our private training takes place where you are: your home, your neighborhood, your park. From there, we create a personalized training plan that takes into account how your dog learns best. And we donâ€™t leave it at that! We offer virtual follow-up sessions to assist with any challenges that may present themselves during the training process. </p>
